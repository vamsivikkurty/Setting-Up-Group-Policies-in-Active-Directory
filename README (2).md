# Setting Up Group Policies in Active Directory

## Description

This repository offers guidance and resources for setting up and managing Group Policies in Active Directory (AD). Group Policies are a powerful feature of Windows Server that allow administrators to centrally manage and enforce security settings, user configurations, and system policies across a network of Windows-based computers. By leveraging Group Policies, organizations can ensure consistent security posture, streamline IT administration, and enhance compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Features

- **Policy Creation and Configuration**: Create custom Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to define specific settings and configurations for users and computers.
- **Security Settings**: Enforce security policies such as password requirements, account lockout policies, and firewall rules.
- **User and Computer Configurations**: Configure user preferences, desktop settings, software installation policies, and system configurations.
- **Group Policy Management**: Organize and manage GPOs using Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or PowerShell cmdlets.
- **Policy Inheritance and Enforcement**: Control the inheritance and enforcement of policies at different levels of the AD hierarchy (domains, sites, OUs).
- **Group Policy Preferences**: Use Group Policy Preferences to deploy and manage settings that are not enforced like traditional policies.
- **Group Policy Reporting and Auditing**: Monitor policy application, track changes, and generate reports for auditing and compliance purposes.

### Prerequisites

To set up and manage Group Policies in Active Directory, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Windows Server**: Active Directory installed and configured on one or more Windows Server machines.
- **Group Policy Management Tools**: Install Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on a management workstation for policy administration.
- **Administrative Access**: Administrative privileges in the Active Directory domain to create and manage Group Policies.
- **Understanding of Active Directory Structure**: Familiarity with AD organizational units (OUs), domains, and trust relationships.
